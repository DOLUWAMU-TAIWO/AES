# AES-Enabled Secure Communication System on Nexys A7 FPGA with MicroBlaze

## Introduction

In the rapidly evolving digital world, the importance of secure communication systems cannot be overstated. With the increasing need for data protection in various fields like IoT, personal data security, and corporate confidentiality, implementing robust encryption techniques has become paramount. This project aims to develop a secure communication system leveraging the power of FPGA (Field-Programmable Gate Array) technology and the versatility of embedded systems. 

Utilizing the Nexys A7 100T FPGA board and the MicroBlaze soft processor, this project will focus on implementing the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) algorithm, a widely recognized standard for secure data encryption. The Nexys A7, known for its high-performance digital circuitry, and MicroBlaze, a flexible and customizable processor from Xilinx, form the perfect combination for realizing an effective encryption system.

## Project Objectives

- **Implement AES Algorithm**: Develop and integrate the AES encryption and decryption algorithm using VHDL or Verilog or utilizing IPs on the Nexys A7 FPGA.
- **MicroBlaze Processor Utilization**: Leverage the MicroBlaze soft processor for controlling the encryption/decryption processes and managing data flow.
- **User Interaction Interface**: Create a simple interface for inputting messages to be encrypted or decrypted, using switches, buttons, or a UART connection.
- **Demonstration of Secure Communication**: Illustrate the system's capability by securely transmitting encrypted messages, potentially to a server or between two systems.
- **Performance and Efficiency**: Optimize the system for speed and resource efficiency, benchmarking the FPGA's capability in handling real-time data encryption.

## Significance

This project not only serves as a practical application in the field of embedded systems and cryptography but also provides a hands-on experience with FPGA programming and digital system design. The successful implementation of this project will demonstrate the effectiveness of FPGAs in secure data transmission, offering insights into their potential in modern encrypted communication systems.
